## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack software developer with a specialty in **Typescript** and **React** with **MongoDB** and **PostgreSQL** databases.

I have experience with: 
- modern React features such as Next.js App Router and Context API
- load-balancing using nginx
- testing using Playwright, Jest, React Testing Library, and k6
- deploying using Vercel and AWS; other languages like Go and Python

I have been working on [My Animal Crossing Island](https://myacisland.vercel.app/), a personal website made with Typescript and React using Next.js with a MongoDB Atlas backend, with continuous deployment on Vercel. I have also been working through [Advent of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com) - an Advent calendar of programming puzzles - and writing my solutions using various languages to gain more appreciation for the differences between Javascript, Go, and Python.

I was previously an aerospace engineer where I used my attention to detail to meticulously check engineering drawings, and my love for efficiency and automation to write macros to quickly parse data and generate reports. That was how I realized I really liked coding and decided to pursue this path.

When I'm not coding, you can usually find me doing crossword puzzles (currently going through the New York Times Archive). I also enjoy memorization. I once memorized 300+ digits of pi for a high school math competition. I lost by 8 digits.
